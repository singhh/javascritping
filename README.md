# javascritping
Here I am going to post and share my journey in javascripting

First javascript project that I worked upon was doing simple Farenheit calculations and returning weather in Farenheit degree. User is asked to input weather in kelvin (more on Kelvin weather scale can be found here: https://www.livescience.com/39994-kelvin.html) and javascript will process the kelvin weather number into Farenheit degrees for you.

I'll keep adding more as I move along.
Thanks!
