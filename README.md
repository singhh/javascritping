Here I am going to post and share my journey in javascripting

First Credit To Codeacademy.com, where I learned about javascripting 
and following is the project that I did.

Codeacademy Javascript Introduction project:

Javascript Project that I Worked Upon Was Doing Simple 
Farenheit Calculations And Returning Weather In Farenheit Degree. 
User Is Asked To Input Weather In Kelvin (More On Kelvin Weather 
Scale Can Be Found Here: Https://Www.Livescience.Com/39994-Kelvin.Html) 
and Javascript Will Process The Kelvin Weather Number Into Farenheit 
Degrees For You. 


I'll keep adding more as I move along.

Thanks!
